# D'CASABoT: Static + Motion Gesture Recognition

This project implements **Filipino Sign Language (FSL) gesture recognition** using:
- **Static gestures** (single frame recognition)
- **Motion gestures** (sequences over time with both one-hand and two-hand support)

The app runs with **Streamlit** and provides a **live webcam feed** to recognize signs in real time.

## üöÄ Features
- Static gesture recognition with a trained CNN model
- Motion gesture recognition with an LSTM sequence model
- Handles **single-hand** and **two-hand** gestures
- Real-time webcam capture via OpenCV
- Interactive Streamlit interface
